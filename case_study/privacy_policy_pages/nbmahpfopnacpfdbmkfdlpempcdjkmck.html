          <p>Personal   Information is information that can be used to identify, locate, or   contact an individual. It also includes other information that may be   associated with Personal Information. We collect the following types of   Personal Information:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Contact Information</strong> that allows us to communicate with you, such as your name, postal   addresses, email addresses, social media website user account names,   telephone numbers, or other addresses at which you receive   communications from or on behalf of The Coupons App.</li>
            <li><strong>Relationship Information</strong> that helps us to understand who you are and what types of stores,   products, and advertisements you might like. This includes lifestyle,   preference, and interest information; the types of coupons that interest   you; information collected from social media interactions (such as via   Facebook Connect); and demographic information (e.g., birth date, age,   gender, zip code).</li>
            <li><strong>Transaction Information</strong> about how you interact with the Services, such as the coupons you view   and redeem, the gift cards you purchase or sell via our Services, the   digital rebates that you claim, including copies of receipts that you   submit; other information about how you use our Services, email, other   communications, and applications; and how you interact with   The Coupons App's merchants, business partners, and service providers after   interacting with our Services, including, in some cases, the items you   purchase from those merchants.</li>
            <li><strong>Location Information</strong> that allows us to periodically determine your geolocation, such as your   location relative to nearby merchants or, your presence within a mall   or store (e.g., near a checkout, aisle, or entrance) or your   state/province, city, or neighborhood. Please see the app menu settings to limit the   Location Information that The Coupons App may collect from the Services   operating on a mobile device.</li>
            <li><strong>Analytics Information</strong> about your use of our Services, such as your IP address, access time,   device ID or other unique identifier (e.g., Android advertising ID or   Apple IDFA), domain name, screen views, language information, device   name and model, operating system type, and your activities on our   Services. For example, information collected by our Services via a   mobile device may include the following: (i) the names of the other   applications on your mobile device and, if you use an Android-based   mobile device, how you use them (e.g., frequency and duration of use);   (ii) if you use an Android-based mobile device, the URL addresses of the   webpages you access; (iii) information about your mobile device (e.g.,   make, model, operating system, and other similar information, but not   phone number); (iv) information about your use of features, functions,   or clicks on notifications or content; and (v) the strength of signal,   temperature, battery level, and unique identifier of a nearby Bluetooth®   proximity beacon.</li>
          </ul>
          <h2 id="how-rmn-collects-personal-information">2. How The Coupons App Collects Personal Information</h2>
          <p>We   may ask you for Personal Information when you register, subscribe,   create an account, or otherwise interact with the Services or contact   The Coupons App. For example, you may be required to provide us with Contact   Information or Relationship Information in order to register for   certain services. </p>
          <p>We collect Personal Information when you use   our Services on one or more of your devices that interact with the   Services. For example, we may track the coupons you view, submit or   redeem via a desktop computer, the gift cards that you purchase from us   via your mobile device, and the comments you make to the forums,   bulletin boards, discussion groups, chat rooms or other methods of   communication that may be offered on or through the Services from time   to time (collectively, "<strong><em>Communities</em></strong>"), or to   those related to our social media pages or accounts. We use cookies and   related technologies to collect information about your computer and your   interaction with the Services and our business partner websites. </p>
          <p>We   also collect Personal Information if you contact us via telephone,   email, text, postal mail, social media interaction, or other methods of   communication, such as for customer support purposes.</p>
          <p>If you use a   social media platform, a mobile device or other third-party method of   communication to interact with The Coupons App or the Services, that   platform may have a specific privacy statement that governs the use of   Personal Information related to that platform. If you have questions   about the security and privacy settings of your mobile device, please   refer to instructions from your mobile service provider or the   manufacturer of your device to learn how to adjust your settings.</p>
          <p>If   you use the Services on a mobile device and your mobile device's   settings allow it, we may collect Personal Information from your mobile   device. For example, if you have permitted your mobile device to   transmit location data, we may collect your geolocation and time of day.   In addition, if you have also enabled Bluetooth® functionality on your   mobile device, our Services may determine your presence and duration   within a location, such as a mall or store, based on the detection of   signals from nearby Bluetooth® proximity beacons. Our application may be   designed to collect information even if you are not logged into one of   the Services. In some cases, for example, we may use your Internet   Protocol (&ldquo;IP&rdquo;) address to estimate your general location even if you   have not logged in or enabled location tracking on your mobile device.   </p>
          <p>From time to time, we may also   supplement Personal Information with information collected from third   parties, including demographic information, information about your   interests, and similar information that the third parties have collected   from other sources (which may include analytics data from third party   websites). For example, we may collect information from third parties to   enhance other information we have about you, to help us better   understand you, to provide you with targeted advertising, and to   otherwise enhance the Services.</p>

          <h2 id="when-and-why-rmn-discloses-personal">4. When and Why The Coupons App Discloses Personal Information</h2>
          <p>We may share your Personal Information as required or permitted by law as described below:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>With   affiliated companies (e.g., subsidiaries and other companies owned by   or controlled by The Coupons App) who may only use the Personal Information   for the purposes described in Section 3 above;</li>
            <li>With our service   providers that provide services for us to assist us in carrying out the   purposes described in Section 3 above such as sending emails, push   notifications, or SMS messages on our behalf, assessing potential fraud   (such as in connection with the purchase or sale of gift cards) and   conducting surveys or sweepstakes on our behalf. Gimbal, Inc., for   example, is a service provider that enables certain geo-location   features of our mobile-device applications. Consequently, Gimbal, Inc.   and its affiliates collect, store, and process, on The Coupons App&rsquo;s behalf,   certain Location Information and related data on servers in the United   States. Our service providers are bound by law or contract to protect   Personal Information and are only allowed to use the Personal   Information in accordance with the terms of our service agreements with   them. In some limited cases, such as for purposes of investigating   suspicious activity and assessing the likelihood for fraud, some of our   service providers may use the Personal Information that we provide them   for the purpose of improving their own services;</li>
            <li>Merchants, but   only to the extent you have redeemed a coupon offered by the merchant,   or participated in an offer, contest or other activity sponsored or   offered through The Coupons App on behalf of the merchant; </li>
            <li>The Coupons App   business partners or advertisers, as part of an offer, contest, or   other activity that is provided by or in conjunction with The Coupons App   and its business partners and in which you have elected to participate.   For example, if you are referred to The Coupons App from a business   partner's website or through an invitation facilitated by or in   conjunction with a The Coupons App business partner, The Coupons App may provide   that business partner with Contact Information and Transactional   Information to validate the referral and to support the terms of the   relationship between The Coupons App and the business partner, which may   allow such business partner to contact you directly and to advertise to   you;</li>
            <li>To effect a merger, acquisition, or otherwise; to support   the sale or transfer of business assets; to enforce our rights or   protect our property; to protect the rights, property or safety of   others, investigate fraud, respond to a government request; or as needed   to support auditing, compliance, and corporate governance functions. We   may also disclose Personal Information to defend ourselves in   litigation or a regulatory action, and when required or advised to do so   by law, such as in response to a subpoena, a reporting requirement or   similar legal process, including to law enforcement agencies,   regulators, and courts in the United States and other countries where we   operate. If The Coupons App is involved in a merger, acquisition, or sale   of all or a portion of its assets, you will be notified via email and/or   prominent notice on one or more of our Services of any change in   ownership or uses of your Personal Information, as well as any choices   you may have regarding your Personal Information; or</li>
            <li>Otherwise with your consent.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>We   encourage The Coupons App merchants and business partners to adopt and post   privacy policies. However, the use of your Personal Information by such   parties is governed by the privacy policies of such parties and is not   subject to our control. When you choose to interact with a The Coupons App   merchant or business partner, we encourage you to read any privacy   policy they may have posted on their website.</p>
          <p>We may also disclose   information about you that is not personally identifiable. For example,   we may provide merchants, business partners, or other third parties   with reports that contain aggregated and statistical data about our   users.</p>

          <h2 id="cookies-and-related-technologies">5. Cookies and Related Technologies</h2>
          <p>When   you use our Services, we collect certain information by automated or   electronic means, using technologies such as cookies, pixel tags, web   beacons, browser analysis tools, and web server logs. As you use our   Services, your browser and devices communicate with servers operated by   us, our business partners and services providers to coordinate and   record the interactivity and fill your requests for services and   information. </p>
          <p>The   information from cookies and related technology is stored in web server   logs and also in web cookies kept on your computers or mobile devices,   which are then transmitted back to our Services by your computers or   mobile devices. These servers are operated and the cookies managed by   us, our business partners or our service providers.</p>
          <p>For example,   when you access our Services, The Coupons App and our service providers may   place cookies on your computers or mobile devices. These cookies may   include means for tracking your Transaction Information with a Merchant   and may include tracking technology from third-party affiliate-network   operators like LinkShare and Commission Junction. Cookies allow us to   recognize you when you return, and track and target your interests in   order to provide a customized experience. They also help us detect   certain kinds of fraud.</p>
          <p>A "<strong><em>cookie</em></strong>" is a   small amount of information that a web server sends to your browser   that stores information about your account, your preferences, and your   use of the Services. Some cookies contain serial numbers that allow us   to connect your activity with the Services with other information we   store about you in your profile.</p>
          <p>Some cookies are temporary, whereas others may be configured to last longer. "<strong><em>Session</em></strong>"   cookies are temporary cookies used for various reasons, such as to   manage page views. Your browser usually erases Session cookies once you   exit your browser. "<strong><em>Persistent</em></strong>" cookies are   more permanent cookies that are stored on your computers or mobile   devices even beyond when you exit your browser. We use Persistent   cookies for a number of purposes, such as retrieving certain information   you have previously provided (such as your user id if you asked to be   remembered), and storing your preferences.</p>
          <p>Pixel tags and web   beacons are tiny graphic images placed on website pages or in our emails   that allow us to determine whether you have performed specific actions.   When you access these pages or open email messages, the pixel tags and   web beacons generate a notice of that action to us, or our service   providers. These tools allow us to measure response to our   communications and improve our web pages and promotions.</p>
          <p>We   collect many different types of information from cookies and other   technologies. For example, we may collect information from the devices   you use to access our Services, your operating system type or mobile   device model, browser type, domain, and other system settings, as well   as the language your system uses and the country and time zone of your   device. Browsers routinely send these types of information to web   servers. Our server logs also record the IP addresses of the devices you   use to interact with the Services. We may also collect information   about the website you were visiting before you came to our Services and   the website you visit after you leave our Services, if this information   is supplied to us by your browser.</p>
          <p>In many cases, the information   we collect using cookies and other tools is used in non-identifiable   ways, without any reference to Personal Information. For example, we use   information we collect about users to optimize our Services and   understand its traffic and usage patterns. In other cases, we associate   the information we collect using cookies and related technologies with   Personal Information. In that case, this Privacy Policy governs how we   use that information.</p>
          <p>Additionally, if you have visited one of our   mobile websites or activated one of our mobile-device applications, and   if the settings on your location-aware device allow us to receive   Location Information, we will collect that automatically. If we   associate Location Information with other Personal Information, this   Privacy Policy governs how we would use that information too.</p>
          <p id="ad-choices">We may allow third parties to use tracking devices through the Services to collect the same type of information for the same purposes as The Coupons App does for itself. For example, The Coupons App has relationships with third party advertising technology and analytics companies, such as Google Analytics, BlueKai, and Adometry, to perform tracking and reporting functions for our Services and, in some cases, to help us place targeted advertisements via the Services or third-party websites. Additionally, we may share non-personally identifiable information from or about you with third parties, including <a href="https://sense360.com/privacy-policy/" target="_blank">Sense360</a> such as location data, a list of installed apps, advertising identifiers, or a cryptographic hash of a common account identifier (such as an email address), to facilitate the display of targeted advertising attribution, research and analytics. Third parties may be able to associate the information they collect with other information they have about you from other sources. We do not necessarily have access to or control over the tracking devices they use, but you may be able to opt out of some of practices. Please note that opting out does not prevent the display of all advertisements to you.</p>
          <p><span id="docs-internal-guid-2dc19195-bba3-841d-7880-ae3bcbdd00b9">We allow third-party companies to collect certain information when you visit our web site. These companies may utilize cookies, pixels or other technologies to collect and use non-personally identifiable information (</span>e.g., hashed data, click stream information, browser type, time and date, subject of advertisements clicked or scrolled over) during your visits to this and other web sites in order to provide advertisements about goods and services likely to be of greater interest to you. &nbsp;To learn more about this behavioral advertising practice or to opt-out of this type of advertising, you can visit the websites of the Digital Advertising Alliance at <a href="http://www.aboutads.info/">www.aboutads.info</a> and Networking Advertising Initiative at <a href="about:blank">www.networkadvertising.org/choices/</a>.</p>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <h2 id="your-choices">6. Your Choices</h2>
          <p>We   think that you benefit from a more personalized experience when we know   more about you and the kinds of coupons you like. However, you can   limit the information you provide to The Coupons App, and you can limit the   communications that The Coupons App sends to you.</p>
          <h4>Email</h4>
          <p>You   can manage your email preferences by logging into the Services via a   desktop computer and navigating to the "Settings" page. You can also   manage your subscriptions by following subscription management   instructions contained in the commercial messages that we send you. You   may choose to subscribe to some types of messages, and may choose to   unsubscribe from others. You may also update your subscription   preferences from time to time. If you wish to opt out of receiving   offers directly from The Coupons App merchants or business partners, you can   follow the opt-out instructions in the emails that they send you.</p>
          <h4 id="opting-out-of-tracking">Opting Out of Tracking</h4>
          <p>Currently,   our Services do not recognize browser do-not-track signals. However,   you may manage how your browser handles cookies and related technologies   by adjusting its privacy and security settings. Browsers are different,   so refer to instructions related to your browser to learn about   cookie-related and other privacy and security settings that may be   available. The Help portion of the toolbar on most browsers will tell   you how to prevent your computer from accepting new cookies, how to have   the browser notify you when you receive a new cookie, or how to disable   cookies altogether. You can opt-out of being targeted by certain third   party advertising companies by visiting the following links: <a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/" rel="nofollow'">Network Advertising Initiative</a>, <a href="https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/6336286?hl=en" rel="nofollow'">Adometry</a>, <a href="http://www.d1.sc.omtrdc.net/optout.html?omniture=1&popup=1&locale=en_US&second=1&second_has_cookie=0" rel="nofollow'">Omniture</a>, <a href="http://www.aboutads.info/choices/" rel="nofollow'">Digital Advertising Alliance</a>, <a href="http://www.privacyfix.com/start/install" rel="nofollow'">PrivacyChoice</a>, <a href="https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout/" rel="nofollow'">Google Analytics</a>, <a href="http://www.optoutmobile.com/optout/index.html" rel="nofollow'">MobileApp Tracking</a>, and <a href="http://www.bluekai.com/consumers.php#optout" rel="nofollow'">BlueKai</a>.</p>
          <h4>Mobile</h4>
          <p>If   you access any of our Services through a mobile device or mobile   browser, you may manage how your Personal Information is shared with   The Coupons App. You may adjust the settings on your mobile device to allow   or prevent the sharing of Location Information. For example, you can   disable "Location" (or "Location Services" on iOS-based devices) on your   mobile device to prevent sharing of Location Information with   The Coupons App or only disable "Bluetooth" to prevent just the sharing of   information collected via nearby Bluetooth® proximity beacons. You may   also manage how your mobile device or mobile browser handles cookies and   related technologies by adjusting your mobile device privacy and   security settings. Please refer to instructions provided by your mobile   service provider or the manufacturer of your device to learn how to   adjust your mobile device and mobile browser settings. Please note that   if you disable the sharing of Location Information, you may be unable to   access some features of our Services that are designed for mobile   devices. Also, in the event that you prevent the sharing of Location   Information, we may still estimate your general location based on the IP   address you use to access our Services.</p>
          <h2 id="accessing-and-correcting-personal-information">7. Accessing and Correcting Personal Information</h2>
          <p>Keeping   Personal Information about you current helps ensure that we offer you   the best coupons available for merchants and business partners. You can   do several things to help keep Personal Information about you current.   You can access, update and delete your Contact Information and the other   information you provided us to use in your profile by logging into the   Services via a desktop computer and clicking on the "Profile" link.</p>
          <p>If   you want to close your account or have other questions or requests, or   if you would like to access or request a correction to any other   Personal Information we hold regarding you, please contact us.</p>
          <p>We   will retain your information for as long as your account is active or   as needed to provide you services. If you wish to cancel your account or   request that we no longer use your information to provide you services, contact us. In   response, we will cancel or remove your information but may retain and   use copies of your information as necessary to comply with our legal   obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements.</p>
          <h2 id="security-of-personal-information">8. Security of Personal Information</h2>
          <p>The Coupons App   follows generally accepted industry standards to protect the Personal   Information that you provide. For example, we regularly monitor our   system for possible vulnerabilities and attacks, and we use a   secured-access data center. No method of transmission over the Internet,   or method of electronic storage, is one hundred percent secure,   however. For this reason, there is no guarantee that information may not   be accessed, disclosed, altered, or destroyed by breach of any of our   physical, technical, or managerial safeguards. If you have any questions   about our security practices, please contact us.</p>
          <h2 id="notice-to-residents-of-countries-outside">9. Notice to Residents of Countries outside the United States of America</h2>
          <p>The Coupons App   is headquartered in the United States of America. Personal Information   may be accessed by us or transferred to us in the United States or to   our affiliates, business partners, merchants, or service providers   elsewhere in the world. By providing us with Personal Information, you   consent to such access and transfers. You also acknowledge and agree   that Personal Information may be subject to access requests from   governments, courts, law enforcement officials, and national security   authorities in the United States in accordance with United States laws.   We will protect the privacy and security of Personal Information   according to our Privacy Policy, regardless of where it is processed or   stored.</p>
          <p>To ensure adequate protection of personal data of the   European Economic Area (the &ldquo;EEA&rdquo;), any transfers of such data outside   of the EEA will be pursuant to the Model Clauses approved by the   European Commission. The Coupons App commits to resolve complaints about   your privacy and our collection or use of your personal information.

          <h2 id="privacy-practices-of-third-parties">10. Privacy Practices of Third Parties</h2>
          <p>This   Privacy Policy only addresses the use and disclosure of information by   The Coupons App through your interaction with the Services. Other websites   that may be accessible through links from our Services may have their   own privacy statements and personal information collection, use, and   disclosure practices. Merchants and business partners may have their own   privacy statements, too. We encourage you to familiarize yourself with   the privacy statements provided by these other parties prior to   providing them with information or taking advantage of an offer or   promotion.</p>
          <h2 id="communities">11. Communities</h2>
          <p>Our Services   contain Communities and other areas where you may be able to publicly   post information, communicate with others (such as via discussion boards   or blogs), review coupons, products and merchants, and submit media   content. All the information you post will be accessible to anyone   with Internet access, and any Personal Information you include in your   posting may be read, collected, and used by others in a manner we cannot   control. For example, if you post your email address along with a   comment explaining how to redeem a particular coupon, you may receive   unsolicited messages from other parties.
